= Credit Card Defaulters: A Machine Learning Approach

== Introduction
This project was done for the module MA4270 in NUS. It highlights our approach taken to determine whether a person is likely to default on their next credit card payment based on certain features as well as gives us a platform to practice methods learned in the module. In addition, we are able to explored other methods outside of the module as well.
